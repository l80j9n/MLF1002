Sanna CANDLESThe scented candle market has a   low   entry   barrier   because   of   its   simple   production   process –         molten wax   [infused with fragrance oils  colouring] poured   into a jar with a wick. The   market   is   fast growing and very fragmented – ranging from:
1.       Mass   produced   low-quality candles ($10+) sold   in discount   stores      supermarkets   .   .   .   .
2.       and   mass   produced   high-end,   premium-brand candles ($40+) sold online, and   in specialty   homeware outlets  department   stores   .   .   .   .
3.      to hand poured artisan candles   ($50+)   by small-scale   manufacturing   enterprise that   are   usually family-run. Sold online and in specialty   homeware   outlets

School teacher Sanna   has been   making   hand   poured artisan candles for the   past   10 years   as   a   hobby and side “business” – selling limited quantities   to   loyal   customers   in   her   neighbourhood.
At the end of 2022 Sanna left her   $100   000/year   high-stress   teaching job, obtained   a   business loan of $200 000 to take her business   to   the   next   level.   As   a   sole   proprietor   Sanna   manages   her   business with 2 full-time production employees from a tiny, converted warehouse   in   Perth.
Her hand poured artisan candles tick all   the   boxes   for   “premium   quality”   but   retail   for   only   $35   each   [online] – attributed to her self-taught production   method and   relatively   low   operating   costs.
Sanna’s   production facility (including labour) has a   maximum   supply   capacity   of   15   000   units/year   [60 units per   day   x   5   days   x   50   weeks].
Sanna CANDLES’s income statement for the 2023   is as follows:

Aria   Foods Co.Self-made   millionaire Judy Smith started   Aria   Foods, a packaged-food   business   based   in   Perth 20   years ago.   After several setbacks because of failed products,   it   is   now   renowned for   its   innovative   products   developed through its well-funded research    development   (R      D)   department.
The private business has most   employees   on   a   bonus-pay   system   where   top   performing   workers            are given shares in the company.   As a   market-leader   in   many food   categories   in Western   Australia,   Aria   Foods   has expansion   plans the   next 5 years - doubling its   production   capacity.
The company recently developed a ready-to-drink   “liquid   meal”   made from   soybean,   dairy   products, and   rice; and   is   high   in fibre, vitamins  nutrients.   It   has the   consistency   of a   McDonald's   thick milk shake and expands   100%   in volume when   ingested.
The ‘meal’ part of the drink consists of chewy tapioca balls   similar to   those   found   in   bubble tea   (“boba”). Therefore,   it   is more filling than any existing food drinks   and the fullness   lasts   as   long   as   a full solid   meal – some   5   hours!
Convenient and   portable, the beverage comes in   patented   plastic   bottle that   allows   the   drink to   last   up to 6 hours once opened and   unrefrigerated.   Both   nutritional and   great   tasting   in   a   wide   variety   of flavours, the “meal-on-the-go” beverage represents an exciting   and   innovative opportunity   in   the   “liquid   meal”   market.The new product was developed as a   low-calorie food   to   address   the   obesity   problem   in   Australia. Almost two-thirds of Australian adults are overweight or obese with most   citing overeating as the primary cause, followed   by   poor food choice.
Question 3
Explain   IN YOUR OWN WORDS at least 5   key   characteristics   (or features)   of   Capitalism –   within the context   of   Aria   Foods.
Also, briefly contrast these characteristics with Socialism.
